# Mask-Detector-using-DL
### Introduction
To fight the Covid-19 virus we just need to maintain social distance and most importantly **wearing a mask**.
In this project, I have used images of people wearing masks and without wearing masks. Using this data,
I have trained my CNN model which is created using **TensorFlow**,**Keras** packages in python so that it will detect that whether you wore a mask or not. In the testing phase, 
I wrote code on Face detection using the **OpenCV** library in python. So in the testing phase, you have to sit right in front of your webcam, and then my Mask Detector will show you whether you wore a mask or not.

### Purpose of the Project
This project aims to design and develop a deep learning model for the detection of wearing a mask or not to prevent the Covid-19 virus.
The ﬁnal accuracy level of my deep learning model is recorded as 0.98 and the loss is recorded as 0.043.
The deep learning model detects whether a person wore a mask or not with the accuracy of 97%.

### Insrtructions:
  To run my code in your computer you have to need following packages Numpy, os, pandas, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCv.
  If your pc does'nt have those packages preinstalled. Follow the steps below
  1. Open the anaconda promt running as administrator.
  2. In the anaconda prompt write the following line for the packages you want.For this project tensorflow, keras, opencv, numpy, os. 
   >pip install packagename
   
  3. Now open the Anaconda Navigator nad install the jupyter notebook. Then load the saved model that i haved uploaded in the repository.
  4. For testing, follow  the testing section in the notebook that i have uploaded.
